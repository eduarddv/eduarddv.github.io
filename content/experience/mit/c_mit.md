From February 2023 through to July 2023 I was invited by Dr. Fox Harrell to conduct games research at the _MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality_. I was under the direct supervision of Dr. Caglar Yildirim.

The research I conducted there consisted of a technical development part, the creation of the _E4UnityIntegration-MIT_ Unity plugin, and an experimental part, a human-subjects study using _E4UnityIntegration-MIT_ on the relationships between physiological data and sense of presence in a VR game). Both together were presented as my bachelor's thesis, earning me full marks (10/10). [View the full thesis.](/assets/documents/Bachelor_Thesis.pdf)
