### Fun Race 3D game tribute

This is a complete 3D 2-player split-screen obstacle course game modelled after the game Fun Race 3D. It was developed in Unity and uses custom made models (except for the player characters). See image below:

Programmed movement, respawning, the dynamic obstacles (spikes, rotating bars, swinging balls...)

It features 5 levels and a variety of obstacles (spikes, rotating bars, swinging balls, etc.).

I was in charge of programming movement (players follow a predetermined path along the course), respawning, and dynamic objects' behaviours, as well as making the levels and obstacles' models.

The game was developed over a series of weeklong sprints in a group of two. <!-- You can view the corresponding Trello board here: -->

This project shows my skill in making simple games in Unity. As the project was coordinated between two people, it also showcases teamwork, the agile methodology, and git.
