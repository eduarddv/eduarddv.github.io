Uh-oh. This page is still under construction!

I had planned to finish this page by the end of the weekend, but if you're reading this it means I encountered unforeseen delays. Sorry about that!

# Portfolio for King Junior C++ Developer - Catalog Games

Thank you for stopping by! This page contains a selection of my work relevant to the Junior C++ Developer - Catalog Games position.

## About Me

Software engineer experienced in game R&D. During my research at MIT I developed an innovative Unity
plugin to integrate players’ physiological signals into the game engine, and subsequently piloted it in the
research group’s human-subjects study.

Strong math skills and deep low-level programming knowledge enable me to navigate tech stacks and tackle
R&D challenges effectively. Tenacious, self-sufficient, personable team player always striving toward expertise.
