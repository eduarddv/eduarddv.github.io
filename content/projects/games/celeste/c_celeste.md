### Celeste game clone

This is a complete 2D platformer modelled after the game Celeste for the PICO-8. It is written directly in C++ and OpenGL, and uses the original game's graphics and sound. See video below:

It features 10 levels and a variety of moves (jump, walljump, directional dash), gameplay elements (springs, which make you bounce; balloons, which restore your dash mid-air; clouds, which are platforms traversable from below), and obstacles (spikes, destructible blocks).

I was in charge of programming physics and movement (jump, walljump, dash), interactive entities (spikes, springs, balloons, destructible blocks, clouds), animations (of the main character and the interactive entities), sound, and menus.

The game was developed over four weeklong sprints in a group of two. <!-- You can view the corresponding Trello board here: -->

This project showcases my command of low-level programming in the context of C++ and OpenGL, as well as my skill developing simple games. As the project was coordinated between two people, it also shows my understanding of teamwork, the agile methodology, and git.
