### E4UnityIntegration-MIT

_E4UnityIntegration-MIT_ is an Android Unity plugin to integrate the Empatica E4 wristband used to obtain physiological measurements into the game engine.

The plugin spawned an associated short paper which I'm in the process of trying to get published. Once it is and there's no anonymity requirement anymore both the paper and the plugin will be linked here.

The plugin was piloted and validated during a small scale human-subjects study exploring the relationships between physiological measurements and sense of presence in a VR game using _E4UnityIntegration-MIT_.

This project, consisting of _E4UnityIntegration-MIT_ and the human-subjects study, was presented as my bachelor's thesis, earning me full marks (10/10).
